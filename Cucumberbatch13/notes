-- Cucumber encourages code reusability concept

main - the code we write to develop the application, we write under main

develop the application
to test the application

test - the code we write to test the application, we write under test

2 things we have in project

-coding  - Java
-non - Java - properties files excel etc.

coding will be at one place
none java will be at another place

-- to write gherkin scenerios, we use feature files

Given user is navigated to HRMS application
When user name enters admin username and password
And clicks on login button
Then admin user is successfully logged in

scenerio -  every scenerio is considered as one test case

why we dont need system.setproperty()- "driver/chromedriver.exe"
if the path is incorrect to webdriver - it will fail, path is limited to one machine
many times it is not compatible with browser
